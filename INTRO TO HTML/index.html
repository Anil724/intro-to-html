        <p>After so many years of struggle india won a t20 wc under rohit sharma.Damn bumrah and damn sky for that catch. Why no one's talking about that catch under pressure. You think it's easy??" There will be plenty chat about it in the final analysis. Right now it's all a bit too breathless!.What a sensational final. What a sensational comeback from India! South needed 30 runs from 30 balls when Jasprit Bumrah came back into the attack. He simply scattered South Africa's poise with the match at their mercy, but it's Hardik Pandya who closes the game out with huge poise. Remember, his key wicket of Klaasen snapped the chase open too. And as for that catch from SKY... gadzooks</p>
